This repository contains the scripts used to tackle Assignment 2 of Introduction to Deep Learning at Leiden University.

Note that the output might be different than the one reported or even truncated, but results for the network experiments is reported in the `task1-experiments.xlsx` file used to create the LaTeX table and the figures are stored in the `figures` folder.

Additionally, the data is too large to upload to the repository but should be downloaded and placed in the `data` folder to run task3.

Otherwise, the tasks are each contained in their own Jupyter notebook and can be executed as long as the required packages are correctly installed.
